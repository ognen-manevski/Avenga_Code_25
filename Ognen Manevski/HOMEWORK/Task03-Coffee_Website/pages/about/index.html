                        <p>
                            Espresso is the foundation of most coffee drinks. It is made by forcing hot water
                            under high pressure through finely ground coffee beans. The result is a small,
                            concentrated shot of coffee with a thick golden crema on top.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because of its strong flavor and rich aroma, espresso is loved by people who enjoy
                            bold and intense coffee experiences. It also serves as the base for drinks like
                            cappuccino, latte, macchiato, and mocha.

                            Latte is one of the most popular coffee drinks in the world. It is made with one
                            shot of espresso and a large amount of steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam.
                        </p>

                            The milk softens the strong taste of espresso, making the latte smooth, creamy,
                            and easy to drink. Many people enjoy adding flavors such as vanilla, caramel, or
                            hazelnut to their latte.

                            Cappuccino is a classic Italian coffee made with equal parts espresso, steamed milk,
                            and milk foam. It has a rich flavor with a light and airy texture on top.

                            It is often served with cocoa powder or cinnamon sprinkled over the foam. Cappuccino
                            is usually enjoyed in the morning and is less commonly ordered after meals in Italy.

                            Cold brew is made by soaking coffee grounds in cold water for 12 to 24 hours.
                            Unlike iced coffee, it is never brewed with hot water.

                        <p>
                            This slow brewing process creates a smooth, less acidic coffee with a naturally
                            sweet taste. Cold brew is refreshing and is especially popular during warm weather.

                            Americano is made by adding hot water to a shot of espresso. This creates a coffee
                            similar in strength to drip coffee but with the rich flavor of espresso.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is believed that the Americano became popular during World War II when American
                            soldiers diluted espresso to match the coffee they were used to drinking.

                            Flat White is a milk-based coffee that originated in Australia and New Zealand.
                            It is made with espresso and finely textured steamed milk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compared to a latte, a flat white has less foam and a stronger coffee taste,
                            making it perfect for those who like creamy coffee without too much milk.

                            Mocha is a delicious combination of espresso, chocolate syrup, and steamed milk.
                            It blends the rich taste of coffee with the sweetness of chocolate.

                            Macchiato means "stained" in Italian. It is made by adding a small amount of milk foam

                            Turkish coffee is made with very finely ground coffee beans that are brewed unfiltered
                            in a special pot called a cezve.

                            It is served with foam on top and thick coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup.
                            Turkish coffee is known for its strong taste and cultural importance.

                            Ristretto is a shorter and more concentrated version of espresso. It uses less water
                            but the same amount of coffee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This makes it richer, bolder, and more intense than a regular espresso shot.
                            It is perfect for true coffee enthusiasts.

                    <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
                    <p>
                        According to legend, coffee was discovered in Ethiopia when a goat herder noticed
                        that his goats became very energetic after eating coffee berries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coffee later spread to the Middle East, then to Europe in the 17th century.
                        At first, many people were unsure about coffee, but it quickly became popular.
                        Today, coffee is one of the most widely consumed drinks in the world.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Early Trade in the Middle East</h3>
                    <p>
                        Coffee has a long and fascinating journey that goes far beyond its legend of discovery.
                        By the 15th century, coffee was being grown and traded in the Arabian Peninsula, especially
                        in Yemen. From there, it spread to Egypt, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire, where coffee houses
                        became important social meeting places.

                    <h3>Coffee Arrives in Europe</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the 17th century, coffee arrived in Europe and quickly gained popularity.
                        Although some people were suspicious of the new drink at first, it soon became fashionable
                        in cities such as London, Paris, and Vienna. Coffee houses were often called “penny
                        universities”
                        because people could exchange news, ideas, and opinions over a cup of coffee.

                    <h3>Coffee Goes Global</h3>
                    <p>
                        As European countries began to establish colonies, coffee plants were taken to new regions.
                        Today, coffee is grown in more than 70 countries around the world, mainly in tropical areas.
                        It has become one of the most important global products and a daily habit for millions of
                        people.
